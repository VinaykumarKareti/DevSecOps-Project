## Project Architecture Overview

This project follows a robust CI/CD pipeline to manage the deployment and maintenance of a three-tier application. The architecture is divided into the following components:

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is managed through Terraform, enabling automated provisioning and configuration of the infrastructure.
- **Jenkins**: Acts as the orchestrator for the CI/CD pipeline, triggering various tasks such as code quality analysis, dependency checks, and building Docker images.

### CI/CD Workflow:
1. **Code Quality Analysis**: Ensures that the codebase adheres to quality standards using automated tools.
2. **Dependency Check**: Analyzes and manages project dependencies to ensure stability.
3. **File Scan**: Scans the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
4. **Docker Image Creation**: Builds Docker images for different application components.
5. **ECR Image Scan**: Uses Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before pushing them to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
6. **Updating Deployment File**: Updates the Kubernetes deployment files in the GitHub repository with the latest image information.
7. **Pushing to ECR Private Repo**: Securely stores Docker images in a private ECR repository.
8. **ArgoCD**: Automates the deployment of the updated images to the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring continuous delivery.

### Application Infrastructure:
- **Frontend Tier**: The user interface is managed in this tier, deploying the front-end pods.
- **Backend Tier**: Handles the business logic and API services, running as backend pods.
- **Database Tier**: Manages data storage and retrieval using database pods.

### Networking & Security:
- **Application Load Balancer**: Directs traffic to the appropriate application tier, ensuring high availability and reliability.
- **Monitoring**: Kubernetes monitoring is implemented using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to ensure system health and performance.

  

This architecture ensures a scalable, secure, and automated deployment process for the application, providing high availability and robust monitoring capabilities.
